# P-S_Research

Our team wants to conduct research on the subject of heart failures and what causes them. We are going to use dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction that contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before.


We want to test our null hypothesis that heart failure depends on the cholesterol level. There are plenty of other features in the dataset, so we might change our null hypothesis during the project implementation and switch to some other more interesting features, but the preliminary hypothesis will be as stated here.
